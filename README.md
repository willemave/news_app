# Newsly

**Your AI-powered knowledge companion.** Newsly pulls in content from across the web, summarizes it with LLMs, generates visual thumbnails, and lets you have real-time voice conversations about anything you've saved — or anything on the internet.

Stop drowning in tabs. Start understanding what matters.

## Why Newsly

- **Smart ingestion** — Drop in any URL or let scrapers pull from Hacker News, Reddit, Substack, Techmeme, podcasts, and Atom feeds. Newsly figures out what it is and does the rest.
- **AI summaries that actually help** — Narrative summaries with key insights, supporting quotes, and takeaways. Not bullet-point slop.
- **Talk to your knowledge** — Deep-dive chat agents with web search dig deeper into any article, corroborate claims, or explore new topics.
- **Live Voice** — Have a real-time spoken conversation with your knowledge base. Ask questions, get answers, interrupt naturally. Backed by ElevenLabs STT/TTS and Claude.
- **Deep Research** — Kick off comprehensive async research sessions that run for minutes, not seconds, with web search and code analysis.
- **Native iOS app** — SwiftUI client with Apple Sign In, share extension, and integrated chat and voice.
