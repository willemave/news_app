"""
Generate test data for the news_app database.

This script creates realistic test data that exercises all fields in the metadata models
(ArticleMetadata, PodcastMetadata, NewsMetadata) with properly structured summaries.

Features:
- Generates articles, podcasts, and news items with complete metadata
- Creates structured summaries with bullet points, quotes, topics, questions, and counter-arguments
- Mimics the structure from app/tests/fixtures/content_samples.json
- Supports flexible configuration via command-line arguments
- Includes items in various states (new, processing, completed) by default

Usage:
    # Generate default amounts (10 articles, 5 podcasts, 15 news items)
    python scripts/generate_test_data.py

    # Custom amounts
    python scripts/generate_test_data.py --articles 20 --podcasts 10 --news 30

    # Only completed items (no pending/processing states)
    python scripts/generate_test_data.py --no-pending

    # Dry run (generate but don't insert)
    python scripts/generate_test_data.py --dry-run

Examples:
    # Large dataset for performance testing
    python scripts/generate_test_data.py --articles 100 --podcasts 50 --news 200

    # Minimal dataset for quick testing
    python scripts/generate_test_data.py --articles 2 --podcasts 1 --news 3
