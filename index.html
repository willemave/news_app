<section class="wp-block-mg-post-container post-container wysiwyg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-mg-post-container-is-layout-d839b035 wp-block-mg-post-container-is-layout-constrained">
<p class="has-drop-cap">IT is one of the most critical functions inside any company. Every employee depends on it, every system flows through it, and almost every operational challenge eventually becomes an IT problem. When IT slows down, everyone feels it: employees are blocked waiting on support, onboarding is painful, rolling out new tools gets bottlenecked, and entire company initiatives end up stalled.</p>



<p>Yet despite IT’s central role, the last decade of tooling has not truly empowered them. The powerful tools are heavy to set up and brittle to maintain; the easy-to-use tools focus on narrow use cases and deflection rather than true automation. IT teams are eager to automate and are more technical than business users. They have experimented with scripts, workflow builders, and more, but the limitations of all these tools still force them to spend the majority of their time on manual work, preventing them from focusing on higher-impact work and enabling the rest of their organizations.</p>



<p>Jake and Alex, the co-founders of <a href="https://www.serval.com/">Serval</a>, experienced this firsthand at Verkada, where they led Product and Engineering and sold primarily to IT teams. They heard the same half-joking request countless times, and it wasn’t about Verkada’s products. They would ask customers, “What else can we build for you?” and IT leaders would reply, “Can you fix my helpdesk too?” These conversations led them to two key insights:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The first was that true automation only works if it is faster to automate something forever than to do it manually once.</li>



<li>The second came from watching the few IT leaders who did take the time to build automations. They would first describe the workflow in one simple sentence, then reveal a sprawling tree of branches, nodes, conditions, and edge cases. Jake and Alex wondered: what if you could actually build the entire automation the same way you describe it? What if one simple sentence truly was enough?</li>
</ol>



<p>These insights were not possible to execute on in the past. Prior generations of AI were not strong enough to make it work, which meant IT teams continued working through manual tasks. That has now changed. With modern LLMs, code generation, and reasoning capabilities, it is finally possible to build a platform where “automate forever” is faster than “fix once.”</p>



<p>Serval is built precisely to deliver on this, and the team is not stopping there. They are using this moment not only to build a system of automation, but to rethink the entire ITSM system of record. As our own Sequoia IT leader, Leon, shared when they chose to become a Serval customer: “Serval is not AI for ITSM – it is ITSM built from AI.”</p>



<p>At the heart of the platform is an AI automation engine that lets teams go from a simple sentence to a deployment-ready automation. IT can describe workflows in natural language, then refine them further &#8211; either in natural language or all the way down to code when needed. This combination of being simple enough for anyone to use, yet deep enough for the most advanced IT builders, has resonated strongly with customers. The workflows are fully explainable and traceable, with all necessary permissions included, giving IT teams complete visibility and control and eliminating hallucination risk.</p>



<p>While their automation engine integrates with existing systems of records, Serval has also built a full-fledged ITSM platform, including a ticketing system, an access management product, an asset management solution, and more. Serval is both the system of engagement and the system of record. This gives IT a single place to build and orchestrate automations, enforce security and compliance, and capture the data that compounds their automation over time.</p>



<p>Customer feedback has been exceptional. We consistently heard how easy Serval is to use, yet how powerful, traceable, and trustworthy its automations are in practice. IT leaders described day-to-day operations being transformed &#8211; automation percentages rising every week, employee satisfaction increasing, and IT teams finally having the bandwidth to tackle projects that had been stuck on the back burner for years.</p>



<p>What was also exceptional, and, to be perfectly honest, not something we expected to hear at this stage:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Many customers have already fully ripped and replaced incumbent ITSM tools and now use Serval as their system of record.</li>



<li>Automation quickly spread beyond IT into HR, Finance, Legal, Engineering, Security, and more. In some cases, companies have churned off dedicated software vendors for some departments because they rebuilt their workflows directly in Serval.</li>
</ol>



<p>At Sequoia, the last time we heard such customer feedback that supports the thesis of IT system of record empowering horizontal enterprise automation was 16 years ago, when we partnered with ServiceNow. That is why we were so eager to partner with Serval and preempt their Series B round.</p>



<p>The market thesis is one half of the story. The other half is the team. References for Jake and Alex &#8211; from managers, direct reports, and peers &#8211; were glowing. Even more importantly, those references aligned perfectly with the evidence we heard from customers and what we’ve observed in talent flows. Strong talent from R&amp;D to GTM is choosing to join Serval, whether or not they have worked with the founders before. The talent density and “potential energy” forming around the company are impressive and represent one of the strongest leading indicators we look for.</p>



<p>Empowering IT teams is an elegant and scalable way to bring AI automation to the enterprise. We are excited to partner with Jake, Alex, and the team at Serval on this journey.</p>

<p>Netflix recently entered into a definitive agreement to buy Warner Brothers for over $82B in Enterprise Value. It&#8217;s being called the biggest, most consequential deal in Hollywood history. The purchase comes with intellectual property including Batman, Superman, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, The Matrix, Lord of the Rings (film rights), Godzilla/MonsterVerse, Mad Max, and Mortal Kombat.</p>



<p id="ember64">IP like this became more valuable in the internet age, and will become even more valuable in the age of AI. Earlier this year, I published an internal Sequoia memo detailing the implications of AI on the IP industry. Given the big news, I thought it would be nice to share a few excerpts with my friends and colleagues more broadly.</p>



<p id="ember65"><strong>If We Have AGI&#8230;</strong></p>



<p>On a recent work trip to Paris, a profound irony struck me at the Musée d&#8217;Orsay. The museum, a glorious former train station, is a temple to the Industrial Revolution. Its collection, spanning 1848 to 1914, chronicles the period of history&#8217;s most rapid industrialization.</p>

<p>This is where the paradox lies. This was the exact moment in history when the cost to reproduce a piece of art dropped precipitously. What was once near-impossible, replicating a masterpiece, became trivially cheap. Logically, as near-perfect copies became ubiquitous, the value of the &#8220;original&#8221; should have plummeted. And yet, the opposite happened. The great lesson of the d&#8217;Orsay is this: instead of becoming worthless in the age of manufacturing, these original works became priceless. As reproduction became easy, the value and allure of the original only went up.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s why IP is well positioned in an AI future:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If we have AGI, or even inexpensive content creation, that will drive down the cost of intelligence.</li>



<li>That affordable intelligence will be used to create an abundance of content.</li>



<li>Humans will react to abundance with a desire for familiarity and quality.</li>



<li>The value of the “original” will only increase.</li>



<li>In this era, “original” works will increase in value quickly.</li>



<li>These “originals” include art, real estate, and intellectual property.</li>



<li>Intellectual property that has already earned a spot in our minds will benefit disproportionately.</li>



<li>In the AI Era, nostalgic content will benefit disproportionately as it is manifest in countless different ways.</li>
</ul>



<p id="ember74">As content production costs approach zero, the marginal cost of new content will also become negligible, leading to an explosion in content volume. This content flood will profoundly shift the value of attention, the primary currency in this new landscape. Undifferentiated content will rapidly lose value, and consumers will be far less willing to invest time in new content unless it&#8217;s algorithmically recommended by dominant platforms. Very few new content concepts will break out, following an extreme Power Law.</p>



<p id="ember75">Success in this environment will hinge on &#8220;attention distribution,&#8221; defined as a consumer&#8217;s inherent interest in a specific piece of content. Nostalgic content is poised to become the most valuable. In a world saturated with novelty, authentic nostalgic content will be incredibly difficult to simulate accurately; even slight deviations from the original will feel inauthentic and cheap.</p>



<p id="ember76">Consumers will be willing to pay for nostalgic content due to its relatively low cost. For parents, the decision to purchase authentic nostalgic content for their children over a knockoff, especially when the real item is priced reasonably, becomes a clear choice.</p>



<p id="ember77"><strong>The Impending Content Deluge and the Scarcity of Attention</strong></p>



<p id="ember78">The ubiquity of General AI will drastically reduce the marginal cost of content production, approaching zero. This will unleash an unprecedented explosion in content volume, creating a hyper-saturated information environment. In this landscape, human attention, rather than content itself, will become the primary scarce resource and the dominant currency. Undifferentiated content, easily replicable and ubiquitous, will rapidly depreciate in value. Consumers, overwhelmed by choice, will increasingly rely on algorithmic recommendations from dominant content platforms to filter and curate their experiences, leading to a profound shift in content discovery and consumption patterns.</p>



<p id="ember79"><strong>Attention Distribution: The New Competitive Moat</strong></p>



<p id="ember80">Success in this AI-driven content economy will hinge on &#8220;attention distribution,&#8221; defined as a consumer&#8217;s inherent and deeply ingrained interest in a specific piece of content. This is distinct from mere algorithmic visibility, as it speaks to an intrinsic desire to engage with content. While AI can generate novel content at scale, it will struggle to replicate the nuanced emotional resonance and deeply embedded cultural references that drive genuine attention.</p>



<p id="ember81"><strong>The Inherent Value of Authentic Nostalgic Content</strong></p>



<p id="ember82">Nostalgic content is uniquely positioned to become the most valuable asset in this future. The core arguments for its enduring value are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Difficulty of Authentic Simulation: While AGI can mimic styles and tropes, accurately simulating authentic nostalgic content will be incredibly challenging. The most popular feature in Sora 2 is their “Cameo” feature, which pulls in authentic characters and people into the AI generated worlds. Even minute deviations from the original, like a slight alteration in a beloved character&#8217;s voice, a subtle anachronism in a period piece, or a deviation in the execution of a well-known narrative, will register as &#8220;inauthentic&#8221; or &#8220;cheap&#8221; to a discerning audience. The emotional connection to nostalgic content is often rooted in precise, well-remembered details, making it highly resistant to imperfect algorithmic replication. This is akin to the &#8220;uncanny valley&#8221; in robotics, where near-human but imperfect simulations evoke discomfort rather than acceptance.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Consumer Willingness to Pay: Despite the approaching zero marginal cost of content, consumers will demonstrate a significant willingness to pay for authentic nostalgic content.</li>
</ul>



<p id="ember85"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>As AI democratizes content creation, the landscape will shift dramatically. The true scarcity will be human attention, and the ultimate value will reside in content that can capture and hold that attention through genuine emotional resonance. Authentic nostalgic content, by virtue of its irreplicable emotional depth and its proven ability to connect across generations, represents a highly defensible and appreciating asset in this evolving digital economy. Investors should prioritize companies that control and strategically leverage these invaluable cultural touchstones.</p>

<p>Humans are visual creatures. Images and video are the most immersive forms of content. It’s no accident that more than 80% of internet traffic is video, that social platforms are becoming image- and video-first, and that video games and movies are the largest categories of consumer spend.</p>



<p>Generative media will be even bigger. At Sequoia’s inaugural AI Ascent event in 2023, Jensen Huang made the provocative prediction that “Every pixel will be generated, not rendered.” Today, that dream appears closer than ever: frontier video and image models have crossed the uncanny valley, and the first compelling use cases of generative media are starting to emerge across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htM_sGmUXaM">advertising</a>, <a href="https://www.thesphere.com/">cinema</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/faith-the-video-bible/id6654890533">storytelling</a> and more.</p>



<p>Projects that once demanded years of work and $100M budgets can now be explored much more quickly and affordably, opening the door to new creative possibilities. We’re seeing generative media begin to transform familiar media use cases: digital ads, viral TikToks, short films, and micro dramas. There will also be wholly new experiences created that we can’t even begin to imagine, from education to personalized media to generated games. The doors to building with creative AI are wide open to anybody with a computer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://fal.ai/">fal</a> has built the leading platform for enterprises and developers to build with generative media models. Video models are compute-intensive and finicky to work with, and creating wonderful outputs requires excellence on multiple levels. fal offers AI creatives exactly what they want for this exciting but strange new paradigm, including 400+ models available on-demand across open- and closed-weight (including models like OpenAI Sora and DeepMind Veo), Day 0 support for new model releases, incredibly fast inference speeds, an ergonomic developer API, an advanced playground UI, and enterprise features around model fine-tunes, styles and collaboration.</p>



<p>fal’s customers are the tastemakers of generative media, with use cases ranging from e-commerce (Shopify) to creative suites (Adobe and Canva) to AI-native platforms (Perplexity) to millions of individual developers. While the momentum behind the business has been staggering, we are even more excited by the quality and caliber of teams currently experimenting on fal, creating immersive new education experiences, virtual pets, indie animation studios, and more. If even a small subset of these explorations make it to production, the world will be a dramatically more colorful, entertaining place.</p>



<p>We are delighted to partner with co-founders Burkay Gur (Coinbase ML) and Gorkem Yurtseven (Amazon) and Head of Engineering Batuhan Taskaya (the youngest-ever Python core developer and maintainer). The team is spiky up and down the platform stack, from having one of the best kernel and compiler inference teams in the world, to nurturing model provider relationships with finesse, to grassroots devrel. Their early bet on generative media shows up across their relationships with model providers, infrastructure performance and ability to dream with creators.</p>



<p>We are at the beginning of a compute explosion in generative video. As the generative media wave accelerates, fal is the inference platform powering the future of AI-first creativity. The team is <a href="https://fal.ai/careers">growing fast</a> to keep up with that demand, and we at Sequoia are proud to lead their Series D.</p>

<p>December ushers in a period of reflection in the investment world, as investors take stock of the previous year and begin to position themselves for the year to come. This is more true than ever right now, as we seem to be in a liminal period; animal spirits have lulled, but AI companies continue to put up strong results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My prediction for 2026 is that it will be a tale of two AIs. On the one hand, it will be a year of delays, first in data center buildouts, many of which will fall behind schedule, and second, in the AGI timeline. At the same time, AI adoption will continue its relentless rise. In 2025, startups coined the idea of a “$0 to $100M” club of rapidly scaling AI companies; in 2026, we’ll begin to talk about the “$0 to $1B” club.</p>



<p>Entering 2026, here are the facts as I see them:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Demand for AI CapEx from the Big Tech companies is stronger than ever</li>



<li>Google and Meta are fully betting the farm on AI</li>



<li>While Microsoft and Amazon pulled back slightly in 2025 relative to peers, both continue to aggressively position themselves for the AI future</li>



<li>Supply chain players seem weary: The customer’s customer is not as healthy as they’d wish. They are worried about being left holding the bag</li>



<li>The end revenue from AI remains limited (on the order of tens of billions per year) relative to the scale of data center and energy investments (on the order of trillions over the coming five years)</li>



<li>There are two killer apps in AI, coding and ChatGPT. Both are expected to approach or cross double digit billions of revenue this year. Nearly a dozen more startups are on the path to cross $100M+ in the near future, across a wide variety of applications</li>



<li>Big enterprises are struggling to implement AI in-house, which is leading to fatigue and disappointment</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Tale 1: The Year of Delays </strong></p>



<p>These countervailing forces will collide in 2026: soaring Big Tech demand will run headfirst into a supply chain that hasn’t scaled fast enough to match it.</p>



<p>First, companies like TSMC and ASML have monopolistic positions and cannot be forced to ramp capacity. Ben Thompson has called this the “<a href="https://stratechery.com/2025/tsmc-earnings-the-tsmc-brake-intel-earnings/?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InN0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LnBhc3Nwb3J0Lm9ubGluZSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJzdHJhdGVjaGVyeS5wYXNzcG9ydC5vbmxpbmUiLCJhenAiOiJIS0xjUzREd1Nod1AyWURLYmZQV00xIiwiZW50Ijp7InVyaSI6WyJodHRwczovL3N0cmF0ZWNoZXJ5LmNvbS8yMDI1L3RzbWMtZWFybmluZ3MtdGhlLXRzbWMtYnJha2UtaW50ZWwtZWFybmluZ3MvIl19LCJleHAiOjE3NjQyMzc4NzksImlhdCI6MTc2MTY0NTg3OSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAucGFzc3BvcnQub25saW5lL29hdXRoIiwic2NvcGUiOiJmZWVkOnJlYWQgYXJ0aWNsZTpyZWFkIGFzc2V0OnJlYWQgY2F0ZWdvcnk6cmVhZCBlbnRpdGxlbWVudHMiLCJzdWIiOiI1ZGNmMDgyYi1jZjFkLTQzNmUtOWI0Ni00Y2EyZTUwMThjMjkiLCJ1c2UiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.dgN_jFVB6xQ2I308h3GlegT57UW9vwNNvX605LOEYuqt5Jd20yacsAUVb_R_0AVhFPwtVmQiV9g2PaxZoI28WYjskrKECAgQUNqog0ntgUk9Trxz03FQfZ_LKyqjkhzGA-5QhzFBkTs9_2_iaiT9qs__ao_GxwpPTEsfu0Yr6AhDz3Fw7t-TmG3S3HZR7C8VfKYYNqMPNCsZEKv5Wgp1o-Lix4huwfPDwzugwWVNQOn78vp4EZRi25ywDytvWpVQbcGixErFYUztfgtXIxUKukogknsYlgOfzHEyWHo2xdmKVb7HeqmPZizjOHsZlzf1At5UxAinXYUao5a7hjWKkA">TSMC Brake</a>,” pointing out in October that while TSMC had ramped revenues by 50% since 2022, they had only ramped CapEx by 10%. He explained further: “There weren’t too many answers from TSMC about this, which is understandable, given that they won’t announce next year’s CapEx numbers until next quarter. What Wei did say is that TSMC was making a point to not just talk to its customers but its customers’ customers.” My prediction, especially coming off of the successful Gemini 3 launch and hype around TPUs, is that the TSMC constraint could become material in 2026.</p>



<p>Second, industrial players, which tend to be overlooked due to their fragmentation and lack of market power, may end up creating bottlenecks as data centers move into the final stages of construction. Generators and cooling units are among the most important industrial inputs to data centers, but there are dozens of such inputs; if any of these inputs are delayed, timelines would need to be pushed out. There are also labor constraints that must be factored in, as shortages in skilled labor could become a key bottleneck for completing these immense construction projects. Many AI companies share a supply base, and these industrial suppliers are faced with their own CapEx decisions (how many new factories to build). We’ll find out in 2026 to what extent they’ve sufficiently added to their own output capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The average AI data center takes roughly two years to build. So if 2024 was the year of new project announcements, and 2025 was the year when construction investments started to hit GDP, then 2026 will either be the year where a lot of this new capacity comes online (leading to further declines in the cost of compute) or it will be the year when many of these construction projects begin to face delays. We already have seen a few of these delays publicly reported in Q4 2025. If hyperscalers begin to warehouse their new AI chips rather than installing them directly into data centers, this will be a telltale sign that the era of delays has begun.</p>



<p>The other way in which 2026 will be the “Year of Delays” has to do with the AGI timeline. For a long time, Silicon Valley luminaries were forecasting the imminent emergence of AGI, with <a href="https://ai-2027.com/">“AGI in 2027”</a> thrown around frequently in conversation. Since June of this year, there has been a progressive walk-back of this timeline. Dwarkesh Patel’s recent podcast interviews with Richard Sutton, Andrej Karpathy, and Ilya Sutskever are a demarcating line; the new consensus is that the AGI window will be in the 2030s, at earliest. In the coming year, I expect this “update” to filter outside of Silicon Valley. There are <a href="https://dcahn.substack.com/p/reasonable-persons-agi">implications across many areas</a>. The most notable risk is that hyperscaler CapEx today ends up being outdated.</p>



<p><strong>Tale 2: The Relentless Drive Toward AI Adoption</strong></p>



<p>The area where I do not expect to see any delays is in AI adoption itself. The fading of hype will have little impact on fundamentals. If anything, the best startups are growing faster than ever from $0 to $100M in revenue. In 2026, we’re going to see the emergence of a $0 to $1B club. The trend of the last three years—and likely for many more—is that startups are laying the foundation for the future economy, one building block at a time. There are many excellent entrepreneurs exploring new niches, and a lot of latent value has yet to be unlocked.</p>



<p>The best AI startups are moving with extreme efficiency—many are earning north of $1M in revenue per employee. This implies market pull vs. a push sale. Today’s entrepreneurs are building “self-improving” companies—they are themselves using AI agents for functions like legal, recruiting, and sales—creating an ecosystem flywheel effect. AI app companies are also riding a compute cost curve that should drive incremental margin improvement, especially as new data centers come online between now and 2030. Finally, with enterprises facing adoption fatigue on DIY implementations, startups are gaining even more momentum.</p>



<p>For some, AI adoption is happening too slowly. Those expecting a rapid AI takeoff would prefer to see a <a href="https://dcahn.substack.com/p/ai-capex-now-hinges-on-deus-ex-machina">deus ex machina moment</a> carry us straight to the finish line. I think that dream is likely to disappoint. Instead, the next leg of the AI story will require hard work, creative brilliance, and endurance to reach a new threshold where AI radically transforms the economy. We need only to look at the green shoots—founder motivation, aggressiveness, hunger to win, customer obsession—to see that this future is coming.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Compute is the most valuable resource in the AI world we live in today. Nvidia. Google TPUs. Amazon Trainium. OpenAI and Broadcom’s <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration/">partnership</a>. Elon’s recent <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1992499020590108745">post</a> about Tesla’s AI chips.</p>



<p>Designing the most performant chips for AI workloads sits at the heart of accelerating technological progress.</p>



<p>But major hurdles exist.</p>



<p>First, chip design is slow. It takes 12-24 months at mature nodes and 18-36 months at the leading edge for 5nm or 3nm.</p>



<p>Second, chip design is prohibitively expensive. It costs on average $200-250 million for 7nm, $450-500 million for 5nm, and $600-650 million for 3nm. Roughly 50-70% of that is human labor. Another 5-15% is Electronic Design Automation tooling spend in a market long dominated by Cadence and Synopsys, where each generates $5-6 billion in annual revenue and are worth approximately $90-100 billion in market cap.</p>



<p><a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/how-alphachip-transformed-computer-chip-design/">AlphaChip</a> caught my eye for these exact reasons. It gave us a peek at AI’s potential to transform the entire chip design process, showing we can cut the floorplanning step in physical design from months to hours.</p>



<p>What if we could extrapolate this and build AI to automate the entire flow, from architecture design to RTL to verification, all the way through physical design?</p>



<p>What if chip design took days, not two to three years? Every day is massively costly; some reports from August 2024 indicated that a multi-month Blackwell delay could result in more than $10 billion in lost revenue for 2025 alone. More importantly, imagine the revenue potential unlocked when new generations of chips are designed faster and shipped earlier.</p>



<p>What if each design didn’t cost hundreds of millions of dollars? What if chip companies didn’t need to operate large human teams on top of clunky EDA tooling?</p>



<p>And most exciting: what if we unlocked novel chip designs we might never have explored?</p>



<p>AlphaChip revealed an important human bias: in chip design, we tend to think in Manhattan grid-like structures. AlphaChip’s designs were different, more organic in shape, more like forms inspired by nature. So different, in fact, that humans wanted to reject them at first … Yet AlphaChip went on to shape four generations of the TPU.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia are so excited to partner with co-founders Anna Goldie and Azalia Mirhoseini, leading their very first round from the formation of Ricursive Intelligence. They pioneered AI for chip design by creating and leading the AlphaChip effort and are at the epicenter of this emerging AI for chip design ecosystem. They are visionaries with incredible clarity of thought, intensely ambitious, humble yet exceptionally accomplished, and real talent magnets who move, and inspire others to move, with urgency and velocity.</p>



<p>Anna and Azalia founded Ricursive Intelligence to build the frontier AI lab defining this category. In just the first weeks since company formation, they have assembled a team with the highest talent density you can imagine in the field.</p>



<p>Their core belief: chip design is the compute bottleneck, and progress in AI, hardware and infrastructure is capped by the speed and efficiency of silicon creation.</p>



<p>In their words: “If we get this right, it’s not just faster chip design cycles; it’s a fundamental expansion of what’s possible in hardware. Once chip design becomes fast and accessible, everyone will be able to customize. The automation here will unlock a flood of new hardware innovation.”</p>



<p>Anna and Azalia’s vision for Ricursive is to define a new movement, from “fabless” to “designless.” Fabless, meaning a company designing chips without owning expensive fabs, outsourcing production to foundries. Designless, meaning outsourcing not only manufacturing but the entire chip design process, taking an idea and converting it into a manufacturable design.</p>



<p>We envision a world where Ricursive helps any company design chips for its own workloads faster, more efficiently and more creatively than is possible today. In doing so, Ricursive can help revolutionize the most valuable resource in our era: compute. We could not be more excited to help build a true generational company in the making.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">In the summer of 2024, Mark Swan, an aspiring founder and former operations lead at Revolut, came to two realizations. The first was that service businesses would be the biggest benefactors of AI, with AI-powered tools helping to streamline operations and offload administration-intensive processes. The second was that one of the sectors with the greatest need for tools to support these tasks was the financial services industry, particularly wealth managers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Swan recognized financial advisors faced an “80/20 problem.” They spent 80% of their time on administrative work, leaving only 20% for time with clients navigating significant, often emotional, financial life decisions, from saving for retirement to paying for their children’s education. Meanwhile, the demand for financial advice was accelerating. As of 2024, the number of affluent households in the U.S. with more than five hundred thousand dollars in investable assets was growing eight times faster than the population. But with such large administrative workloads, Swan learned, wealth management firms suffered an inability to scale and serve more clients. And the current tools for assisting with their administrative overhead weren’t cutting it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From his research, Swan developed a third realization, this one contrarian. While many predicted tools for AI would replace human roles in the financial services sector, Swan believed the opposite: that in a world increasingly dominated by AI, human-led advice would become all the more important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward to today — Nevis is a New York City-based AI platform for Registered Investment Advisors. Founded by Swan (CEO), Philipp Burda (CPO) and Ivan Chalov (COO), Nevis came out of stealth in early December. The company raised a $5 million seed round from Sequoia in 2024 and a Series A of nearly $35 million from Sequoia, ICONIQ and Ribbit Capital in 2025, bringing its total funding since inception to $40 million. Nevis’s thesis is simple: AI won’t replace financial advisors, but it can turbocharge them, offering tools that give wealth managers 80% of their time back. This will allow them to have deeper and more meaningful relationships with clients and enable them to scale to serve more people. Nevis’s rapidly growing customer base currently includes some of the fastest-growing wealth management firms in the U.S., collectively overseeing more than $50 billion in client assets.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Swan, Burda and Chalov first crossed paths at Revolut. Burda rose through the ranks as head of fincrime, then head of data science for the retail product, and, finally, partner and head of Revolut’s GenAI product initiatives. Meanwhile Chalov ascended from data scientist to general manager of retail business at Revolut. In their three years of overlap, the co-founders’ professional alchemy flourished. “We were absolutely smashing in terms of coming up with ideas, approaches, shortcuts and all these tricks,” Burda says. “I was very impressed by Ivan, how hardworking he is and logical at the same time. And Mark, I was blown away by the things he was doing and the quality of his work.” When Swan left Revolut in the spring of 2024 to pursue his own venture, Burda and Chalov encouraged him to stay in touch in case there was an opportunity for further collaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Swan’s drive to bring meaningful change to an industry dates back to his childhood in Aberdeen, Scotland. His initial goal, however, was to become a politician. “I always knew I wanted to do something that would have the biggest impact on the world,” Swan says. “At the time, I felt the way to do that was through politics.” Swan rigorously plotted his course, diving into books and excelling in school — achieving more A-levels than any other Scottish student at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, across the globe, Chalov’s and Burda’s fathers were fanning the enterprising flame in their own sons. “My father is an entrepreneur who tried everything: running a computer hardware store, owning a local newspaper, selling cars, even running a duck farm,” says Chalov, reflecting on his childhood in Akademgorodok, a small research town in Siberia. Meanwhile, Burda’s Russian physicist father was taking a more direct approach in encouraging a problem-solving spirit in his son — handing him books on HTML and math puzzles anytime they went on a car ride. Burda’s first stab at company-founding was at 15, when he started a short-lived web design agency with friends. He spent the next decade in academia, while Chalov worked as a trader at an investment bank, before both shifted industries to join the ranks at Revolut.</p>



<p>Swan was the last to arrive at Revolut. Before leaving for university, he had spent a year as an intern with Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management — an experience that opened his eyes to the potential of changing the world through business and technology. Following graduation, he pursued work in this space. His first official day in the Revolut office, however, began with a whimper. Swan showed up in the summer of 2021, excited to be in-person among co-workers after the pandemic’s remote era, only to discover an empty floor. He searched for his assigned line manager, but that person was nowhere to be found. Halfway through the day, after working alone for a number of hours, a man approached and asked his name. When he replied, “Mark Swan,” Chalov stuck out his hand. He informed Mark that the line manager in question no longer worked there; Swan would now report to him. “I wanted to join Revolut because I knew it was going to be like a rocket ship,” Swan says, “and I was going to learn better there than anywhere else. Just go drink from the fire hose. That was exactly my experience.”</p>



<p>Around this time, unbeknownst to Swan, his name went on Sequoia’s list of “prefounders” to keep an eye on, thanks to Edward O’Carroll, a former talent lead at Sequoia. “We have a term called ‘dynamo’ at Sequoia for people who are slightly earlier in their careers, but we would describe them as very high slope in terms of their rate of evolution,” says George Robson, a partner at Sequoia who wrapped up his own time at Revolut in 2020. “Mark was put on this list for exactly that reason — he was a ‘dynamo.’”</p>

<section class="wp-block-mg-post-container post-container wysiwyg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-mg-post-container-is-layout-d839b035 wp-block-mg-post-container-is-layout-constrained">
<p class="has-drop-cap">In the months after leaving Revolut, Swan heard repeatedly from those across service businesses that while a storm of startups offering AI-powered tools was emerging, the actual delivery of those promised products was falling short. “In a lot of professional services markets, like wealth tech, for example, you have AI companies who don’t fully understand that industry and how to build proper product solutions, but who are trying to sell the dream saying, ‘We’ll create an army of digital workers, which will work for you 24/7,’” explains Burda. “Realistically, those companies that don’t know how to build robust AI-native products in a regulated environment will have their products delayed and delayed. Advisors are being burned by false propositions, and customers lose trust in those companies, plus they’re missing out on proper tools that can help them now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Swan zeroed in on an AI platform for wealth management, he identified trust as a key pillar of what would ultimately become Nevis. He also recognized that his deep experience building cutting-edge AI products at scale in financial services during his time at Revolut was a core differentiator. It would give customers confidence in his product and set his company apart.</p>



<p>In an act of shrewd business strategy with a dash of kismet, around this time Edward O’Carroll brought Swan’s name up to Sequoia partners Robson and Luciana Lixandru as a potential investment. “We had a meeting with Mark in our office,” Lixandru says. “I remember thinking, how is he 26? He’s just mature way beyond his years. He’s so accomplished, so ambitious, and has so many outlier characteristics. I had forgotten the feeling of meeting a founder and just knowing on the spot that you want to back them. That happens once a year, where you have an ‘aha’ moment right away.”</p>



<p>The seed investment from Sequoia happened swiftly in September 2024, almost as if Swan had manifested it. Swan admits he’s a closet “manifestor” — his favorite method is to write something down on a piece of paper and will it into existence. In this case, the piece of paper that he scribbled on the day he left Revolut, which he still keeps to this day, says he’d have seed money by the time he went to his parents’ wedding anniversary that fall. Sure enough, Swan found himself boarding a flight to Aberdeen, feverishly crunching numbers as he stepped toward the jet bridge. “I remember vividly trying to do the mental maths in my head. I’m trying to work out, is this deal good? Is it not good?” Swan recalls. The partnership was formalized, and, shortly thereafter, Burda and Chalov left Revolut to co-found Nevis with Swan.</p>



<p>Armed with a seed investment, the trio doubled down on understanding pain points within the wealth management sector, speaking at length with financial advisors to learn more about the 80/20 problem. Above all, what they heard repeatedly was that financial advisors valued their relationships with clients and that clients put enormous trust in their financial advisors — trust they didn’t want to cede to AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People don’t want robots telling them how to manage their life savings,” says Swan, who has a personal connection of his own to financial advisors — or rather, a memory of the absence of one that gives him a perspective on their value. “Growing up, my parents did most of their investing themselves,” Swan says. “They weren’t in a position to have an advisor because the cost was too high. One of our goals with Nevis is to reduce the cost to serve, so advisors can support more clients and open access to high-quality financial advice for millions of people who don’t receive it today.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their business soon took shape. The co-founders created an AI “system of action” for financial advisors to reduce hours spent manually inputting data, updating records, and searching for information across fragmented systems. Unlike its point solution competitors, Nevis intentionally started with a more holistic product that can automate workflows end-to-end. Its platform connects to clients’ CRMs, email and messenger apps, and document storage systems, pulling from this data to assist in meeting preparation, to generate reports on investment performances and to maintain or make changes to clients’ accounts.</p>



<p>Confident in their product, the Nevis co-founders approached their Sequoia partners with a go-to-market plan centered on the U.K. Robson and Lixandru challenged them, however, to look at other, larger markets where AI is more rapidly being deployed. The trio eventually came to the conclusion that the U.S. had the same banking woes and pain points as the U.K. but was culturally ripe for this type of innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To win customers’ trust, Swan and his co-founders prioritized in-person meetings, even if it meant traveling long distances, both to demonstrate the value of Nevis and also to build meaningful connections with those using the product. For United Capital, Swan flew to Newport Beach, California, discovered that Jim Rivers, the company’s president, loved to surf and turned one coffee meeting into a multi-day affair. For Apollon Wealth Management, Swan flew to Tampa and drove four hours to Miami for a thirty-minute sit-down with COO Brad Goodman, which evolved into a multi-hour strategy meeting, ultimately landing Nevis yet another customer.</p>



<p>Even after winning clients, Swan continues to regularly sit down with firms in person. “It’s beyond being on a first name basis,” says Robson. “By actually going and frequently spending time with clients, Mark is able to earn a very high level of confidence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevis’s decision to come out of stealth mode is a result of the momentum it’s seeing in the U.S. “We have enormous market demand,” Swan says, “and what’s more, we have validation from current customers around the strength of our product. We felt now was the time to bring this platform that we know is extremely valuable to a larger market.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevis is rapidly growing its headcount, as it focuses on scaling and building new products. It continues to attract those who cut their teeth at Revolut; many of Nevis’s current employees, like its co-founders, are alumni of the company. Swan, Burda and Chalov recognize that people — from the internal team at Nevis, to the wealth management firms that use their product, to the clients depending on trusted advisors for wealth management — are the key to the company’s success. The founders are direct with each other when making decisions and direct with their clients when tackling their needs. Most importantly, Swan, Burda and Chalov know that to harness AI effectively, it needs to be developed through the exacting lens of tools and processes that can deepen trust amongst humans in the workplace instead of erasing it.</p>

<section class="wp-block-mg-post-container post-container wysiwyg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-mg-post-container-is-layout-d839b035 wp-block-mg-post-container-is-layout-constrained">
<p class="has-drop-cap">Imagine you’re a night watchman for a self-storage facility, alone at your station at 2 a.m. A motion sensor goes off near the back fence, but a quick scan of your security cameras shows nothing. You head over to the area, calling the police on your way, but by the time you find the three cut padlocks in the last row of units, it’s too late. The thief has disappeared into the darkness—along with your customers’ belongings.</p>



<p>Security is a rising concern for owners of large outdoor properties, including data centers, stadiums, and warehouses, around the world. Theft, vandalism, and trespassing are costly not only in terms of repairs and insurance payments, but also reputation and lost business—and at public facilities like airports, the stakes are even higher. When you have miles of ground to patrol, cameras and human guards can only do so much, so quickly—and when you’re facing a security threat, every second counts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now imagine this, instead: within five seconds of that motion sensor trigger, a drone automatically takes off. It arrives at the fence long before you do—recording every second as you watch live. Humming overhead, the drone is impossible for the intruder to miss, and they flee before any damage is done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the peace of mind made possible by <a href="https://sunflower-labs.com/">Sunflower Labs</a>, the company transforming how commercial campuses, critical industrial sites, and communities defend themselves. Sunflower’s “Beehive” is an AI-powered drone system that can patrol acres of properties with zero manual intervention and in almost any weather, detecting everything from people and vehicles to water leaks and fires. A new FAA approval ensures the system can operate across 99% of the U.S., keeping customers ahead of both current and planned future regulations. The system has the potential to become a core component in the future of physical security—and it’s a 10x cost advantage compared to traditional patrols.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sunflower co-founders Alex Pachikov, Chris Eheim, and Nick de Palézieux have designed an incredible product, combining resilient hardware with easy-to-use software and integrating with a host of existing security solutions. This intentional craftsmanship is no surprise, given the technical background of the founders and their team. Many Sunflower engineers come out of ETH Zürich—one of the best universities in the world for drone and robotics technology. </p>



<p><a href="https://sunflower-labs.com/#use-cases">Customers</a> are as impressed as we are with both the team and product. A <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-politics/sbb-takes-action-against-sprayers-with-drones/87444049">Swiss railway system</a> deterred thieves, graffiti artists, and trespassers. A <a href="https://sunflower-labs.com/residential">community</a> in Los Angeles improved coverage for its residents. A <a href="https://sunflower-labs.com/commercial">self-storage company</a> uses Beehive to protect their facilities, check on maintenance issues, and more. And with this round of funding, Sunflower will leverage AI to take their already exceptional product to the next level, to deepen their partnerships with other security platforms, and to bring the beehive to an even larger global audience.</p>



<p>The future is bright for Alex, Chris, Nick, and their <a href="https://sunflower-labs.com/jobs">growing team</a>—and thanks to them, it is more secure for us all.</p>

<section class="wp-block-mg-post-container post-container wysiwyg has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-mg-post-container-is-layout-d839b035 wp-block-mg-post-container-is-layout-constrained">
<p>We are excited to launch our latest venture fund and our sixth dedicated seed fund to continue partnering with the next generation of outlier founders at the start of their journey.</p>



<p>There is something magical about forming partnerships in the earliest days and then witnessing their evolution. Initial ideas grow into legendary companies—from Apple to Nvidia to Stripe to Wiz. This keeps us dreaming about the possibilities of the future. Today, founders face a once-in-a-generation opportunity, as AI is poised to reimagine every industry. We are at the precipice of a foundational platform shift as transformative as the rise of the internet. As with any tech supercycle, there will be both euphoria and troughs of disillusionment, but when we look back thirty years from now, generational companies will have been created that alter our world in unimaginable ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We seek founders of any background from around the globe who see possibility where others see limits, with the unshakable grit to turn impossibility into reality. As we launch our latest seed and venture funds, we asked our Early team to share a few emerging themes that excite them about the opportunities ahead:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/"><strong>Lauren Reeder</strong><br></a><em>“Video and image models have come a long way in terms of character consistency, crisp editing and photorealism. This step change will enable a host of new applications to be built on top. I&#8217;m particularly excited about how that gets applied to the world of consumer apps. We connect better and are more engaged by videos and images than we are with text. There&#8217;s a whole new category of companies to be created around these new models.<br><br>I’m also excited about the evolving infrastructure layer of the software development stack. We&#8217;ve seen what it takes to build an application change dramatically with LLMs at the core. As the app layer matures, it&#8217;s becoming clearer what new infrastructure primitives are needed to build the next generation of applications.”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/"><strong>Bogomil Balkansky</strong></a><br><em>“Security and observability are two huge, interesting domains in need of solutions. LLMs can’t effectively solve problems in these domains off the shelf, because there are no public sources of security data or observability data to train them. Since LLMs alone are not enough, these are fruitful fields for companies to innovate with other forms of AI and find new solutions.”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/"><strong>Josephine Chen</strong></a><br><em>“We’re about to see a new world of consumer apps. Anytime there’s a platform shift, it opens up new dimensions in how people live. Stablecoins will change how consumers interact with financial services. Healthcare will transform as people take their health into their own hands with the help of LLMs. We&#8217;re also seeing step function changes in voice, video and robotics: these will fundamentally shift the way people interact with technology and with each other.”</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/luciana-lixandru/"><strong>Luciana Lixandru</strong><strong><br></strong></a><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>I am excited to meet founders who use Europe as their product and engineering hub, but who want to take over the world. Europe’s founder pool has never been stronger. A new wave of repeat entrepreneurs and alumni from breakout scaleups bring hard-won judgment, world-class product taste, and the muscle memory of going from zero to global.”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/dean-meyer/"><strong>Dean Meyer</strong></a><br><em>“One of the most interesting opportunities is in network security, which is going through a fundamental reset. The network itself is evolving to more distributed users across more applications and edge devices. AI is accelerating this shift, and the volume of requests is multiplying. We believe the next generation of network security will likely be identity-driven—built around users, devices, and even AI agent permissions. </em></p>



<p><em>Also, as more data centers come online, we&#8217;re thinking about data center security. As AI workloads concentrate in specialized hardware, the infrastructure is turning into a new attack surface. Securing the new compute layer, not just the network, is becoming critical.”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/"><strong>Konstantine Buhler<br></strong></a><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>E-commerce is ripe for reinvention with AI. There is a huge opportunity in usage revenue (as in, AI agents getting paid to do tasks like a person might) as well as new monetization for purchases in-app. OpenAI recently announced a service to do research and buy products in the chat app. This is just the beginning. We think there&#8217;s a </em><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-retail-opportunity/"><em>multi-trillion dollar opportunity for commerce in AI</em></a><em>, and we&#8217;re hopeful we get to back the next Amazon for the AI era.<br><br>Additionally, 2025 was the year that voice AI went mainstream. But there are so many industries based on phone calls still waiting for solutions. For example: the financial services industry, where 92% of fixed income is still traded over the phone.”</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/george-robson/"><strong>George Robson</strong></a><br><em>“I see a lot of potential in providing digital asset solutions to regulated financial institutions. Cryptocurrencies have existed at the periphery of financial services for a long time, but new regulations in the US and Europe mean that financial institutions can start to buy these products and sell them to their customers. Today, there&#8217;s a big mismatch between the expertise that’s long existed in crypto and the kind of expertise that exists among large banks and other institutions. We&#8217;re looking for early-stage companies to help bridge that gap.<br><br>Additionally: Most medical data is currently not being used to accurately package and price products. For example, in the UK, we&#8217;ve had longitudinal electronic data since the 1980s, but very little of it is being used to price things like medication, life insurance, etc. We&#8217;re excited for teams that will tackle those problems.”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/alfred-lin/"><strong>Alfred Lin</strong><br></a><em>“Almost every single industry will be disrupted by AI. If you study the history of the internet, mobile, and cloud, each of those technology waves brought business model transformations. The same will be true of AI. So far, AI has automated some of our most mundane work, but we look forward to the new creative ideas that can come out of AI. New business processes, consumer experiences we haven’t seen before, new ways to play… I think many of those experiences can be truly transformative in our lives.”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/shaun-maguire/"><strong>Shaun Maguire</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><em>“Silicon photonics has been a holy grail idea for decades. It&#8217;s finally starting to happen, just as the use cases are exploding: The bottleneck in AI is multiplying big matrices, and you can do this efficiently with silicon photonics. I think the impact of silicon photonics in the next 50 years will be similar to the impact of silicon electronics in the last 50.<br></em></p>



<p><em>Separately, I’m interested in partnering with founders in Israel. I think the Israeli tech ecosystem has reached maturity, and that Wiz is just the beginning of many exciting companies to come. I like to back people when they&#8217;re underestimated, and I think the entire Israeli ecosystem is underestimated right now.”</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/"><strong>Charlie Curnin</strong></a><br><em>“Having fun might be the most underrated use case for AI. Ten years ago, entertainment came from others making content for us: movies, music, stories, characters, worlds. Today, we make our own. From Suno to Sora, we’re seeing how AI enables more creativity, more delight, more people participating in the fun of making, remixing, sharing and consuming.”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/julien-bek/"><strong>Julien Bek</strong></a><br><em>“The physical world represents 80% of global GDP. The companies who win the new frontier of physical AI will become some of the largest companies in the world. We are entering a hardware renaissance, and we’re excited to partner with the companies pioneering this new supercycle.</em><br><br><em>I’m also interested in AI Forward Deployed Engineers. For every $1 spent on software, up to $6 are spent on services. The services industry requires more human workers than ever to deploy AI in production. This is a $500B growing labour market, where labour is supply-constrained. We need AI to help humans be more productive, initially as co-pilots and eventually as autopilots.”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/"><strong>Stephanie Zhan</strong></a><br><em>“As AI becomes superintelligent, it not only automates services but also advances the frontier of what’s possible in each field. We&#8217;re seeing this in every sector, from coding to physical AI. What happens when AI transforms every industry you can imagine: consumer, engineering, product, security, sales, marketing, finance, legal, medicine, education, manufacturing? We are living through the most exciting time in history.”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/roelof-botha/"><strong>Roelof Botha</strong></a><br><em>“I&#8217;m drawn to dynamo founders—polymaths with a voracious appetite for learning, who blend interdisciplinary insights. These people don&#8217;t follow the conventional path. They’re defiant. They want to chart their own course. With the tools that we have available now in AI, founders like this can address problems that they spot in ways that we could never have done before.”</em></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Congratulations to Harrison, Ankush, Julia and everyone at LangChain on today’s $125M Series B funding announcement. It’s been a delight working with this team since leading the <a href="https://sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-langchain-the-llm-application-framework/">Series A</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond the funding, today marks the release of <strong>langchain 1.0</strong>, a major rite of passage for any open source company. Releasing 1.0 reflects the team’s conviction that LangChain, as currently built and packaged, is the right foundational architecture to become the scaffolding for agent engineering.</p>



<p>LangChain is one of the most popular open-source projects in AI with <a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/langchain">90M</a> monthly downloads, and is used by 35% of the Fortune 500. The company has quickly grown from an open source package to a full-fledged agent engineering platform, including a low-level agent orchestration and runtime called <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langgraph">LangGraph</a> that’s used by companies such as Uber, Klarna, LinkedIn and J.P. Morgan; and an observability and agent deployment platform called LangSmith used by Clay, Cloudflare, Replit, Vanta, Rippling, Mercor and more.</p>



<p>LangChain is one of the most used, debated <em>and </em>sometimes misunderstood projects and companies in AI. Below are some reflections on the evolution of LangChain to date and how I view the opportunity ahead.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-days">Early Days</h2>



<p>Harrison Chase’s superpower is simple: he sees the future of agents. He saw it before just about anybody, and has consistently pushed the frontier of agent engineering forward.</p>



<p>Harrison started LangChain as a nights-and-weekends side project back in 2022, right as ChatGPT was taking off. The original LangChain was a proof-of-concept of what language models were capable of becoming: connect them with tools, chain them together into a sequence of calls and business logic, and voila, model becomes agent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harrison’s vision struck a chord with developers, and the LangChain project quickly became one of the fastest adopted open source projects. By the time we led the Series A in early 2023, it had more than 2,000 open-source contributors and was being used by more than 50,000 LLM applications. After two years of exponential growth, it is now surpassed only by OpenAI in download volume.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-plain-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="816" height="478" src="https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/10/Downloads_LangChain.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20558" srcset="https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/10/Downloads_LangChain.png 816w, https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/10/Downloads_LangChain.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/10/Downloads_LangChain.png?resize=768,450 768w, https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/10/Downloads_LangChain.png?resize=220,129 220w, https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/10/Downloads_LangChain.png?resize=680,398 680w, https://sequoiacap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/10/Downloads_LangChain.png?resize=480,281 480w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">September 2025 Download Metrics (PYPI) (in millions)</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crucible-moment-langgraph">Crucible Moment: LangGraph</h2>



<p>As the ecosystem matures, LangChain has matured alongside it, constantly growing the core open source package while also adding in new capabilities.</p>



<p>Because the LLM ecosystem is evolving at such a rapid clip, maintaining the scaffolding to support a developer ecosystem of this size hasn’t always been easy. But Harrison has been resilient and unflappable, constantly listening hard to his challengers and evolving the package towards the future.</p>



<p>Sometime last year, it became increasingly clear that the abstraction level on which the OG LangChain was built was a convenient launching point for developers, but wasn’t sufficiently low-level enough to support all the granular control that developers were craving as the space matured.</p>



<p>Harrison made the hard decision to develop another framework in parallel: LangGraph allows developers to control every step of their custom agent with low-level orchestration, memory, and human-in-the-loop support, and manage long-running tasks with durable execution. </p>



<p>This was a tough but remarkably wise call. Today, LangGraph is the most popular low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, used by companies including Uber, Klarna, LinkedIn and J.P. Morgan and downloaded <a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/langgraph">12M</a> times a month.</p>



<p>Getting one open-source project to broad product-market fit could be a function of luck. Getting two open-source projects to PMF is a testament to how clearly Harrison and the broader LangChain team see the future of agent development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-langchain-1-0">LangChain 1.0</h2>



<p>Today marks a new chapter, merging LangChain’s past and future: the team has completely rewritten langchain in its 1.0 release to be opinionated, focused and powered by LangGraph’s runtime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that langchain 1.0 has all the “0-to-1 booster fuel” the community has come to expect—pre-built architectures for common agent patterns, improved model and tool integrations, and more—but gives developers access to a deep level of customization and control. </p>



<p>In addition, helping developers on their agent engineering journey means expanding beyond frameworks into developer tools. Working with LLMs requires a mindset shift, from deterministic software to embracing stochasticity, constantly observing and testing data. To that end, the team has invested heavily in LangSmith, which enables agent engineering across the full lifecycle: observability, evaluation and deployment.</p>



<p>LangSmith has proven successful as a standalone developer platform for LangChain and non-LangChain developers alike, and is currently used by companies such as Clay, Cloudflare, Replit, Vanta, Rippling and Mercor, with traffic growing 12x year over year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-ahead">What’s Ahead</h2>



<p>LangChain’s ambitions are large. This team will not stop until they become the de facto platform for all of agent engineering. They will get there by deepening their core offerings, and continuing to push the frontier.</p>



<p><em>Deepening the core: </em>The team has pushed hard on deployment, making it possible to ship your agent in one click on LangSmith, using scalable infrastructure built for long-running tasks. They’ve also launched their first 1P agent, an Insights Agent in LangSmith Observability that automatically categorizes agent behavior patterns, as well as a no code text-to-agent builder experience for business users.</p>



<p><em>Pushing the frontier</em>: As the model space progresses, the agentic building blocks also evolve. LangChain has been hard at work on many of the core primitives we believe will drive the future of agentic engineering, including memory.</p>



<p>It’s hard to believe LangChain is just three years old. We are proud to partner with a team that has adapted so resiliently, and more important, <em>driven</em> so much innovation in the agent engineering ecosystem. Today’s milestone is just the beginning.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Every so often, a new interface emerges that redefines how we interact with computers. The keyboard. The mouse. The touchscreen. Today, we believe we’re at the start of the next great shift—where voice becomes a primary interface to AI.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sesame.com/">Sesame</a> is a company bringing computers to life—not just as tools, but as thought partners. They are building a voice-first AI that you actually want to spend time with, who’s always right there with you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-your-personal-agent"><strong>Building Your Personal Agent</strong></h3>



<p>This is not another productivity assistant. It’s something different: a lifelike, expressive collaborator—designed to engage and evolve with its user over time.</p>



<p>Co-founders Brendan Iribe, the former CEO and co-founder of Oculus, and Ankit Kumar, the former CTO of Ubiquity6 are focused on creating a social, emotionally intelligent experience, grounded in conversation and personality. The team’s approach is also rooted in something fundamental—our biology. Humans evolved for voice. It’s our most natural and nuanced communication interface. By leaning into that, Sesame opens up a new design space—one that more closely resembles the free flowing interactive mode of verbal communication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voice is particularly challenging because small changes in tonality, accent, and breathing impact our perception of the person that we’re speaking with. These distinctions may appear to us subconsciously, but we are consciously aware that “this voice sounds human” or “this sounds like a robot.” Roelof saw this first-hand during the rise of YouTube: When faced with tradeoffs between audio and video quality, the company prioritized the former. The YouTube team discovered that while consumers can live with grainy videos, they have absolutely no tolerance for choppy audio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sesame team, with their obsessive attention to detail, has combined technical excellence with craftsmanship in their pursuit of the perfect AI conversational partner. This shows up everywhere, from the system’s vocal cadence and memory model, to the team’s investment in expressiveness and character. Models are already very intelligent and will only get more intelligent over time. The big unlock for future usefulness is therefore most likely to come from new, more natural ways of interacting with them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-research-preview-to-real-connection"><strong>From Research Preview to Real Connection</strong></h3>



<p>In February, Sesame shared an early <a href="https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice">demo</a>, showcasing the team’s voice model through two characters: Maya and Miles.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/talking-with-sesames-ai-voice-companion-is-amazing-and-creepy-see-for-yourself/">response</a> was remarkable. In the first few weeks, more than one million people were drawn to engage with it, generating more than five million minutes of conversation.</p>



<p>Many members of the Sequoia team were among them. We spent hours talking to Maya and Miles, and the experience was unlike anything we’d used before. Sesame’s conversational layer felt different. It doesn’t just translate LLM output into audio—it generates speech directly, capturing the rhythm, emotion, and expressiveness of real dialogue. The voices felt alive—engaging, witty, even surprising. It was fun. Maya and Miles both have character and personality.</p>



<p>We kept coming back, not because we needed to—but because we wanted to. That’s what ultimately led us to partner, co-leading Sesame’s Series B.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-voice-in-the-real-world"><strong>Voice in the Real World</strong></h3>



<p>Sesame’s vision is to build an ambient interface that is always available and has contextual awareness of the world around you.&nbsp; To achieve that, Sesame is creating their own lightweight, fashion-forward AI-enabled glasses designed to be worn all day. They’re intentionally crafted—fit for everyday life.</p>



<p>Fashion will matter here. Glasses like this can’t just be functional—you need to look great in them. Sesame has a unique taste, sense of style, subtlety and cultural awareness. These are glasses you’d wear even without the technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hardware takes time, but it is fundamental to delivering AI that’s integrated into everyday moments. The Sesame team has deep experience leading full-stack product efforts from prototype to global distribution. This experience will be critical to meeting the ambitious goals they have set in front of them—and ultimately to getting a fantastic product into consumers hands soon.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-the-interface-of-the-future"><strong>Building the Interface of the Future</strong></h3>



<p>We all have a sense that AI will reshape society. But for that to happen at scale, the interface needs to feel effortless and human—not mechanical. That’s where Sesame is focused. Not just on intelligence, but on how intelligence is delivered—in a way that feels engaging, personal and enduring. We believe that craftsmanship and taste will set Sesame apart from the competition.</p>



<p>The breadth and urgency of the problem they’re solving has attracted a high-caliber and <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/sesame">growing</a> team, including Oculus co-founder Nate Mitchell as chief product officer. &nbsp;We believe, with voice, Sesame will unlock much of AI’s latent power. Models will continue to improve, but what matters to users is the surface: the quality of the experience, the trust in the system and the feeling that it understands them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re honored to support Brendan, Ankit, Ryan, Nate, Hans, Angela and the rest of the Sesame team as they take on one of the most important problems in AI: how we connect with computers, and how we feel when we do.</p>
