Please write out a super detailed architecture.md file in the docs/ folder. This file should include all the details to explain the code, architecture, database, types, interfaces and any other details that are necessary to understand the _code_ of the system, don't worry about scripts or operational items.

Specifically make sure: 
1. All classes are represented with description and interface. 
2. Database schema is described as a markdown table. 
3. All types / schemas used in the app are included. 
4. Mermaid diagram of the system architecture. 
5. Key points to how things like authentication, apis, storage, etc work.
