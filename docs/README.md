# Docs Index

This folder is organized by doc type for easier browsing.

- `docs/architecture.md` — canonical system architecture reference
- `docs/features/` — feature-specific documentation
- `docs/guides/` — operational, setup, and product guides
- `docs/integrations/` — third-party integration notes
- `docs/operations/` — deployment and maintenance playbooks
- `docs/reference/` — exported API/SDK/technology references
- `docs/specs/` — implementation plans for new functionality
- `docs/plans/` — historical plans and long-form design notes
- `docs/deploy/` — deployment-specific runbooks

If you want, I can also add a generated tree index with short summaries for each file.
